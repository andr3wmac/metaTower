metaTower v0.4.0
----------------

Windows Binary:
    Simply run metaTower.exe and connect using one of the IP address it lists.

From Source:
    On linux you can use python 2.6 or 2.7. Just run metaTower.py and connect in your browser.
        Note: mbrowser uses ffmpeg to convert and dlmanager uses python-libtorrent.

    On windows use python2.6. Everything should work pretty easily.
